1.0.2
+ Updated to 0.19
+ Mixed case hex strings are now valid.
+ (BigInt.fromString "") no longer equals (BigInt.fromString "0")
+ mod renamed to modBy. Returns Maybe instead of crashing now. `modBy 0 n` == Nothing
+ Fixed bug where `BigInt.fromInt 1234567812345678 |> BigInt.toString` would cause a crash.
+ BigInt.toHexString now prepends "0x" or "-0x". Hex strings should be produced as they are consumed.
